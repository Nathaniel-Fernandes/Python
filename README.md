# Portfolio of Python Projects
In creating this repository, my goal is to hone my python programming skills by working on real projects. Each file (or folder) will be an individual project, which will include instructions to run it on your own machine.

I have taken these project ideas from the following sources (in order):
1. [11 Python Projects Developers Can Build for Coding Practice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-junior-developers/)
